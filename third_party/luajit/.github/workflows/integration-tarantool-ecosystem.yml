concurrency:
  # An update of a developer branch cancels the previously
  # scheduled workflow run for this branch. However, the default
  # branch, and long-term branch (tarantool/release/2.11,
  # tarantool/release/2.10, etc) workflow runs are never canceled.
  #
  # We use a trick here: define the concurrency group as 'workflow
  # run ID' + # 'workflow run attempt' because it is a unique
  # combination for any run. So it effectively discards grouping.
  #
  # XXX: we cannot use `github.sha` as a unique identifier because
  # pushing a tag may cancel a run that works on a branch push
  # event.
