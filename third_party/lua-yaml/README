NAME
    yaml - Lua YAML serialization using LibYAML

SYNOPSIS
    require 'yaml'

    serialized = yaml.dump({ 1, 2, 3, 4 })
    content = yaml.load(serialized)

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a Lua binding for Kirill Siminov's excellent LibYAML.
    LibYAML is generally considered to be the best C YAML 1.1 implementation.
    LibYAML 0.1.3 is included as part of this release.

    This module defines the functions dump, load, and configure within the
    global yaml table.

    Portions of this software were inspired by Perl's YAML::LibYAML module by
    Ingy döt Net.
