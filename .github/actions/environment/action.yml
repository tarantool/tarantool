        # that all tags will exists always.

        #
        # 1. Build package on testing branch. It will produce package
        #    with name 2.4.7.x (because of the exception mentioned
        #    below).
        # 2. Build package on tag 2.4.8. It will produce package with
        #    name 2.4.8.x.

        # on saving the commonly named packages, lets drop a tag that
        # points to a current commit (if any) on a job triggered by
        # pushing to a branch (it will produce the package based on
        # previous tag) and leave the new tag in job triggered by tag.
