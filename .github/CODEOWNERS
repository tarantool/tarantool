# Alexander Turenko wants to track all the activities around the
# declarative configuration.
#
# NB: GitHub's code owners documentation states the following.
#
# > If you want to match two or more code owners with the same
# > pattern, all the code owners must be on the same line. If the
# > code owners are not on the same line, the pattern matches only
# > the last mentioned code owner.
#
# As result @tarantool/devx should to be added explicitly here for
# testing directories if there are other code owners.
