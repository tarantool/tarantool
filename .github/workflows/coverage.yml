  # We use a trick here: define the concurrency group as 'workflow run ID' +
  # 'workflow run attempt' because it is a unique combination for any run.
  # So it effectively discards grouping.
  #
  # Important: we cannot use `github.sha` as a unique identifier because
  # pushing a tag may cancel a run that works on a branch push event.
