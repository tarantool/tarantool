# The idea of this workflow is to be simple and developer-friendly.
#
# You don't have to read all the comments: it is better to just
# follow the code. The workflow has a lot of remarks regarding
# a motivation to use this and not that. They're not necessary to
# understand what is going on.
#
# {{{ Design choices
#
# Overview
# ========
#
# To achieve the simplicity several choices are made:
#
# * Use GitHub hosted runners.
# * Don't attempt to enhance GitHub Actions.
# * No secrets or deployments.
# * No hacks for unusual tests.
# * Keep all the logic within a single file.
#
# However, there are several choices, where a complication is
# taken as acceptable in the sense that the workflow is still
# readable without a deep context.
#
# * Perform several builds in one workflow.
# * Split testing to jobs per test suite.
# * Cache submodules build.
#
# Let's look into these points.
#
# Self-constraints
# ================
#
# Use GitHub hosted runners
# -------------------------
#
# This way we don't deal with any infrastructural questions here.
#
# For example, we don't have to use docker and support our own
# docker images for testing.
#
# Also, actions/checkout needs a couple of hacks to make it
# working on a self-hosted runner (at least git clean for
# submodules, fetching tags for submodules, removing lock files
# left by a previous job).
#
# At the same time the GitHub hosted runners provide a good
# parallelization level (60 jobs in parallel on the Team plan)
# and we shouldn't experience large delays during development.
#
# At least, if we experience delays with a basic testing on
# this amount of parallel jobs, we should consider to reduce
# workloads.
#
# Don't attempt to enhance GitHub Actions
# ---------------------------------------
#
# There are things that are not supported by GitHub Actions
# natively, but technically possible to implement on top of it.
# We don't do that here.
#
# For example:
#
# - Cancel in-progress jobs on a new push to a non-release
#   branch.
# - Skip jobs on a push to a fork.
# - Skip some jobs depending on pull request labels.
#
# No secrets or deployments
# -------------------------
#
# In particular, no Telegram/VK Teams notifications.
#
# This way we don't have to bother about forks, where the
# secrets are not available. The workflow just works in the
# upstream and in the fork and that's nice.
#
# We have less security questions to consider.
#
# Everything that we want to achieve here is to verify
# correctness of the code on the given commit. Deployment jobs
# need to give a special care about build dependencies,
# generated versions (sometimes even for submodules) and other
# aspects of reproducible-to-some-extent builds. We don't do
# that here.
#
# No hacks for unusual tests
# --------------------------
#
# If a test requires a special setup, it is likely not to be run
# here. Instead of extra complication of this workflow, consider
# creating a separate one with a needed setup.
#
# Keep all the logic within a single file
# ---------------------------------------
#
# The testing steps should be simple enough to feel like a shell
# script. Once we experience a need to hide some logic behind an
# our own action or a reusable workflow, we likely
# overcomplicate the logic and splitting it doesn't really help
# with understanding.
#
# Also, don't make this action reusable, because it also means
# splitting the logic: we inject some steps here that are needed
# for the outside workflow.
#
# Deliberate complications
# ========================
#
# Perform several builds in one workflow
# --------------------------------------
#
# It seems that it doesn't complicate things too much.
#
# Split testing to jobs per test suite
# ------------------------------------
#
# At first, it allows to restart a smaller piece of the workload
# if an unstable test failed.
#
# Next, it allows to achieve larger parallelization level and
# the feedback from CI is faster this way.
#
# Cache submodules build
# ----------------------
#
# It is too attractive to have such a fast build. We use the
# submodule hash to don't rebuild it each time.
#
# }}} Design choices
#
# TODO
# ====
#
# This workflow is not ready to replace existing workflows that
# perform the same build types. The reason is that
# tarantool/luajit uses the existing workflows as reusable ones.

          # First, there are tests that uses error injections,
          # which are only available on the debug build.
          #
          # Second, the debug build has assertions enabled, so it
          # can spot a problem that passes unseen on the release
          # build.
          #
          # Third, the debug build has Lua's strict mode enabled

          #
          # OTOH, the release build is what a customer typically

          # However, a release deployment job anyway performs the

      #

      #   given sources, at least for libunwind.
      # * Even if all the intermediate files are here, the files
      #   from the cache have the modification time in the past
      #   (it is preserved by caching) and the freshly cloned
      #   source files are newer than them.

      # -------

      # Zero tolerance about unstable tests would be nice, but it
      # doesn't work good for us, at least for now.
      #
      # A developer who mets the flaky failure is not necessarily
      # one who is responsible for the given subsystem. So, he/she
      # reports the unstable test and restarts the job. It takes
      # some human attention and time, so we're interested in
      # minimizing such situations.
      #
      # Even if an author of the test mets the unstable failure,
      # he/she may have other ongoing work now. It is often not OK
      # to stop everything, lost needed context from the head and
      # work on fixing the test or a problem in tarantool that it
      # reveals.
      #
      # In short, a flaky problem in one subsystem shouldn't block
      # the development of other subsystems.
      #
      # This way we add some tolerance for unstable tests using
      # the --retry option.
