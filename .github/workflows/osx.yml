        # and then gets its ID.
        #
        # For some reason, sometimes GitHub doesn't give the complete job list
        # and there is no chance to find the job and get its ID. At least, it
        # has been noticed for this workflow with 32 parallel jobs.
        #
        # It looks like the issue resides on the GitHub side and the simplest
        # way to resolve this is to ignore the failure and not fail the whole
        # workflow due to this GitHub bug.
