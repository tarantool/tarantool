* The `SCALAR` and `NUMBER` types have been reworked in SQL. Now `SCALAR`
  values cannot be implicitly cast to any other scalar type, and `NUMBER`
  values cannot be implicitly cast to any other numeric type. This means that
  arithmetic and bitwise operations and concatenation are no longer allowed for
  `SCALAR` and `NUMBER` values. In addition, any `SCALAR` value can now be
  compared with values of any other scalar type using the `SCALAR` rules
  (gh-6221).
