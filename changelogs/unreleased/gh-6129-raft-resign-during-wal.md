## bugfix/raft

* Fixed a rare crash with the leader election enabled (any mode except `off`),
  which could happen if a leader resigned from its role at the same time as
  some other node was writing something related to the elections to WAL.
  The crash was in debug build, and in the release build, it would lead to
  undefined behavior (gh-6129).
