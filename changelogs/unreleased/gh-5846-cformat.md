## bugfix/core

* Fixed wrong type specification when printing fiber state change which led to
  negative fiber's ID logging (gh-5846). For example

  ```
  main/-244760339/cartridge.failover.task I> Instance state changed
  ```
  instead of proper
  ```
  main/4050206957/cartridge.failover.task I> Instance state changed
  ```
