## Compatibility

Tarantool 2.x and 3.x are compatible in the binary data layout, client-server
protocol, and replication protocol. It means upgrade may be performed with zero
downtime for read requests and the order-of-network-lag downtime for write
requests.

Please follow the [upgrade procedure][upgrade] to plan your update actions.

Users of Tarantool 2.x may be interested in the [compat][compat] options that
allow to imitate some 2.x behavior. This allows to perform application code
update step-by-step, not all-at-once.
