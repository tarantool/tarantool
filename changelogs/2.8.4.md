## Functionality added or changed

### Build

* Support fedora-35 build. (gh-6692)

## Bugs fixed

### Core

* Fixed a crash that could happen in case a tuple is deleted from a functional
  index while there is an iterator pointing to it (gh-6786).
* Fixed memory leak in interactive console (gh-6817).
* Fixed an assertion fail when passing tuple without primary key fields
  to before_replace trigger. Now tuple format is checked before execution
  of before_replace triggers and after each one (gh-6780).
* Banned DDL operations in space on_replace triggers, since they could lead
  to a crash (gh-6920).
* Fixed a bug due to which all fibers created with `fiber_attr_setstacksize()`
  leaked until the thread exit. Their stacks also leaked except when
  `fiber_set_joinable(..., true)` was used.

### Vinyl

* Immediate removal of compacted run files created after the last checkpoint
  optimization now works for replica's initial JOIN stage (gh-6568).
* Fixed crash during recovery of a secondary index in case the primary index
  contains incompatible phantom tuples (gh-6778).

### Raft

* Reconfiguration of `box.cfg.election_timeout` could lead to a crash or
  undefined behaviour if done during an ongoing election with a special WAL
  write in progress.

### LuaJIT

* Fixed top part of Lua stack (red zone, free slots, top slot) unwinding in
  `lj-stack` command.
* Added the value of `g->gc.mmudata` field to `lj-gc` output.
* `string.char()` builtin recording is fixed in case when no arguments are
  given (gh-6371, gh-6548).
* Actually made JIT respect `maxirconst` trace limit while recording (gh-6548).

### Lua

* Fixed ``table.equals`` result when booleans compared (gh-6386).
* Tap subtests inherit strict mode from parent (gh-6868).

### Box

* Add iterator type checking and allow to pass iterator as a box.index.{ALL,GT,...} directly (gh-6501).

### HTTP client

* Fixed invalid headers after redirect (gh-6101).

### Recovery

* When `force_recovery` cfg option is set, Tarantool is able to boot from
  `snap`/`xlog` combinations where `xlog` covers changes committed both before
  and after `snap` creation. For example, `0...0.xlog`, covering everything up
  to vclock `{1: 15}` and `0...09.snap`, corresponding to `vclock `{1: 9}` (gh-6794).
