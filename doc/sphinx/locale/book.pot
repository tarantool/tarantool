If the whole function is invoked with ``sum_json_field(\"Quantity\")``, then ``field_value = lua_table[field_name]`` is effectively the same as ``field_value = lua_table[\"Quantity\"]`` or even ``field_value = lua_table.Quantity``.

In this mode, tuples which were allocated before the snapshot has started are not freed until the snapshot has finished. To preserve consistency of the primary key, used to iterate over tuples, a copy-on-write technique is employed. If the master process changes part of a primary key, the corresponding process page is split, and the snapshot process obtains an old copy of the page. In effect, the snapshot process uses multi-version concurrency control in order to avoid copying changes which are superseded while it is running."

Any system call which can block will be performed asynchronously, and any running fiber which must wait for a system call will be preempted so that another ready-to-run fiber takes its place and becomes the new running fiber.

When a client connects to a Tarantool server, the server sends a random `Salt Value`_ which the client must mix with the hashed-password before sending to the server. Thus the original value 'x' is never stored anywhere except in the user's head, and the hashed value is never passed down a network wire except when mixed with a random salt. This system prevents malicious onlookers from finding passwords by snooping in the log files or snooping on the wire.

But sophia is a working key-value engine and will especially appeal to users who like to see data go directly to disk, so that recovery time might be shorter and database size might be larger. For architectural explanations and benchmarks, see `sphia.org`_ and Appendix E: :ref:`sophia <sophia>`. On the other hand, sophia lacks some functions and options that are available with memtx.

The rule of thumb is to make sure the buffer can contain at least a few dozen requests. Therefore, if a typical tuple in a request is large, e.g. a few kilobytes or even megabytes, the read-ahead buffer size should be increased. If batched request processing is not used, it’s prudent to leave this setting at its default."

It integrates the LuaJIT -- \"Just In Time\" -- Lua compiler, Lua libraries for most common applications, and the Tarantool Database Server which is an established NoSQL DBMS. Thus it serves all the purposes that have made node.js and Twisted popular in other environments, with the additional twist that it has a data persistence level."

Outside Mail.Ru the software is used by a growing number of projects in online gaming, digital marketing, and social media industries. While product development is sponsored by Mail.Ru, the roadmap and the bugs database and the development process are fully open. The software incorporates patches from dozens of community contributors. The Tarantool community writes and maintains most of the drivers for programming languages.  The greater Lua community has hundreds of useful packages most of which can become Tarantool extensions."

Or they can define **Lua programs** that are loaded during startup for triggers, background tasks, and interacting with networked peers. Unlike popular application development frameworks based on a \"reactor\" pattern, networking in server-side Lua is sequential, yet very efficient, as it is built on top of the **cooperative multitasking** environment that Tarantool itself uses. A key feature is that the functions can access and modify databases atomically.  Thus some developers look at it as a DBMS with a popular stored procedure language, while others look at it as a replacement for multiple components of multi-tier Web application architectures. Performance can be a few hundred thousand transactions per second on a laptop, scalable upwards or outwards to server farms."

Instead of the operating system's concurrency primitives, such as mutexes, Tarantool uses cooperative multitasking to handle thousands of connections simultaneously. There is a fixed number of independent execution threads. The threads do not share state. Instead they exchange data using low-overhead message queues. While this approach limits the number of cores that the server will use, it removes competition for the memory bus and ensures peak scalability of memory access and network throughput. CPU utilization of a typical highly-loaded Tarantool server is under 10%."

Two storage engines are built-in: an in-memory engine which has all the data and indexes in RAM, and a two-level B-tree engine for data sets whose size is 10 to 1000 times the amount of available RAM. All storage engines in Tarantool support transactions and replication by using a common **write ahead log** (WAL). This ensures consistency and crash safety of the persistent state. The server performs inserts and updates atomically -- changes are not considered complete until the WAL is written. The logging subsystem supports group commit."

Each branch is represented by a file on disk. Branch size is a configuration option and normally is around 64MB. Each branch is a collection of pages, serving different purposes. Pages in a fully merged branch contain non-overlapping ranges of keys. A branch can be partially merged if there were a lot of changes in its key range recently. In that case some pages represent new keys and values in the branch. The disk-based storage engine is append only: new data never overwrites old data."
