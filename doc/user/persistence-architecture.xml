<title>Data persistence</title>
<para>
To maintain data persistence, Tarantool writes each data change
request (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) into a write-ahead log. WAL
files have extension <filename>.xlog</filename> and are stored in <olink
targetptr="wal_dir"/>. A new WAL file is created for every <olink
targetptr="rows_per_wal"/> records.  Each INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE
gets assigned a continuously growing 64-bit log sequence number.
The name of the log file is based on the log sequence
number of the first record this file contains.
</para>

<para>Apart from a log sequence number and the data change request
(its format is the same as in the binary protocol and is described
in <link
xlink:href="https://github.com/mailru/tarantool/blob/master/doc/box-protocol.txt"><filename>doc/box-protocol.txt</filename></link>),
each WAL record contains a checksum and a UNIX time stamp.
</para>

<para>
Tarantool processes requests atomically: a change is either
accepted and recorded in the WAL, or discarded completely.
Let's clarify how this happens, using REPLACE command as an
example:
<orderedlist>
    <listitem><para>
    The server attempts to locate the original tuple by
    primary key. If found, a reference to the tuple is retained
    for later use.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    The new tuple is then <emphasis>validated</emphasis>. If it
    violates a unique-key constraint, misses
    an indexed field, or an index-field type does not
    match the type of the index, the change is aborted.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    The new tuple replaces the old tuple in all
    existing indexes.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    A message is sent to WAL writer running in a
    separate thread, requesting that the change is recorded in the WAL.
    The server switches to work on the next request until the write 
    is acknowledged.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
    On success, a confirmation is sent to the client. Upon
    failure, a rollback procedure is begun.  During the rollback
    procedure, the transaction processor rolls back all changes to
    the database which occurred after the first failed change, from
    latest to oldest, up to the first failed change. All rolled back
    requests are aborted with <olink targetptr="ER_WAL_IO"/>
    error. No new change is applied while rollback is in progress.
    When the rollback procedure is finished, the servers restarts
    the processing pipeline.
    </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
One advantage of the described algorithm is that complete request
pipelining is achieved, even for requests on the same value of the
primary key. As a result, database performance doesn't degrade
even if all requests touch upon the same key in the same space.
</para>

<para>
The transaction processor and the WAL writer threads communicate
using asynchronous (yet reliable) messaging; the transaction
processor thread, not being blocked on WAL tasks, continues to
handle requests quickly even at high volumes of disk I/O. A
response to a request is sent as soon as it is ready, even if
there were earlier incomplete requests on the same connection.  In
particular, SELECT performance, even for SELECTs running on a
connection packed with UPDATEs and DELETEs, remains unaffected by
disk load.
</para>

<para>
WAL writer employs a number of durability modes, as defined
in configuration variable <olink targetptr="wal_mode"/>. It is
possible to turn the write ahead log completely off, by setting
<olink targetptr="wal_mode"/> to <emphasis>none</emphasis>.
Even without the write ahead log it's still possible to take a
persistent copy of the entire data set with
<olink targetptr="save-snapshot"/>.
</para>
