/**
 * This is an implementation of Raft leader election protocol, separated from
 * synchronous replication part.
 *
 * The protocol describes an algorithm which helps to elect a single leader in
 * the cluster, which is supposed to handle write requests. And re-elect a new
 * leader, when the current leader dies.
 *
 * The implementation follows the protocol to the letter except a few important
 * details.
 *
 * Firstly, the original Raft assumes, that all nodes share the same log record
 * numbers. In Tarantool they are called LSNs. But in case of Tarantool each
 * node has its own LSN in its own component of vclock. That makes the election
 * messages a bit heavier, because the nodes need to send and compare complete
 * vclocks of each other instead of a single number like in the original Raft.
 * But logic becomes simpler. Because in the original Raft there is a problem of
 * uncertainty about what to do with records of an old leader right after a new
 * leader is elected. They could be rolled back or confirmed depending on
 * circumstances. The issue disappears when vclock is used.
 *
 * Secondly, leader election works differently during cluster bootstrap, until
 * number of bootstrapped replicas becomes >= election quorum. That arises from
 * specifics of replicas bootstrap and order of systems initialization. In
 * short: during bootstrap a leader election may use a smaller election quorum
 * than the configured one. See more details in the code.
