/**
 * SWIM - Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group
 * Membership Protocol. It consists of 2 components: events
 * dissemination and failure detection, and stores in memory a
 * table of known remote hosts - members. Also some SWIM
 * implementations have an additional component: anti-entropy -
 * periodical broadcast of a random subset of the member table.
 *
 * Each SWIM component is different in both protocol payload and
 * goals, and could even use different messages to send data. But
 * SWIM describes piggybacking of messages: a ping message can
 * piggyback a dissemination's one.
 *
 * SWIM has a main operating cycle during which it randomly
 * chooses members from a member table and sends to them events +
 * ping. Replies are processed out of the main cycle,
 * asynchronously.
 *
 * When a member unacknowledged too many pings, its status is
 * changed to 'suspected'. The SWIM paper describes suspicion
 * subcomponent as a protection against false-positive detection
 * of alive members as dead. It happens when a member is
 * overloaded and responds to pings too slow, or when the network
 * is in trouble and packets can not go through some channels.
 * When a member is suspected, another instance pings it
 * indirectly via other members. It sends a fixed number of pings
 * to the suspected one in parallel via additional hops selected
 * randomly among other members.
 *
 * Random selection in all the components provides even network
 * load of ~1 message on each member per one protocol step
 * regardless of the cluster size. Without randomness each member
 * would receive a network load of N messages in each protocol
 * step, where N is the cluster size.
 *
 * To speed up propagation of new information by means of a few
 * random messages SWIM proposes a kind of fairness: when
 * selecting a next random member to ping, the protocol prefers
 * LRU members. In code it would be too complicated, so
 * Tarantool's implementation is slightly different, easier:
 *
 * Tarantool splits protocol operation into rounds. At the
 * beginning of a round all members are randomly reordered and
 * linked into a list. At each round step a member is popped from
 * the list head, a message is sent to it, and then it waits for
 * the next round. In such implementation all random selection of
 * the original SWIM is executed once per round. The round is
 * 'planned', actually. A list is used instead of an array since
 * new members can be added to its tail without realloc, and dead
 * members can be removed easily as well.
 *
 * Also Tarantool implements the third SWIM component -
 * anti-entropy. Why is it needed and even vital? Consider the
 * example: two SWIM nodes, both are alive. Nothing happens, so
 * the events list is empty, only pings are being sent
 * periodically. Then a third node appears. It knows about one of
 * the existing nodes. How can it learn about the rest? Sure,
 * its known counterpart can try to notify its peer, but it is
 * UDP, so this event can be lost. Anti-entropy is an extra simple
 * component, it just piggybacks random part of the member table
 * with each regular message. In the example above the new node
 * will learn about the third one via anti-entropy messages from
 * the second one sooner or later.
 *
 * Surprisingly, original SWIM does not describe any addressing,
 * how to uniquely identify a member. IP/port fallaciously could
 * be considered as a good unique identifier, but some arguments
 * below demolish this belief:
 *
 *     - if instances work in separate containers, they can have
 *       the same IP/port inside a container NATed to a unique
 *       IP/port outside the container;
 *
 *     - IP/port are likely to change during instance lifecycle.
 *       Once IP/port are changed, a ghost of the old member's
 *       configuration still lives for a while until it is
 *       suspected, dead and GC-ed. Taking into account that ACK
 *       timeout can be tens of seconds, 'Dead Souls' can exist
 *       unpleasantly long.
 *
 * Tarantool SWIM implementation uses UUIDs as unique identifiers.
 * UUID is much more unlikely to change than IP/port. But even if
 * that happens, dissemination component for a while gossips the
 * new UUID together with the old one.
 *
 * SWIM implementation is split into 3 parts: protocol logic,
 * transport level, protocol structure.
 *
 *     - protocol logic consists of how to react on various
 *       events, failure detection pings/acks, how often to send
 *       messages, handles the logic of the three components
 *       (failure detection, anti-entropy, dissemination);
 *
 *     - transport level handles routing, transport headers,
 *       packet forwarding;
 *
 *     - protocol structure describes how packet looks in
 *       MessagePack, how sections and headers follow each other.
