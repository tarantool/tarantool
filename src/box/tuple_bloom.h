/**
 * Tuple bloom filter builder.
 *
 * Construction of a bloom filter proceeds as follows.
 *
 * First, tuples of the target set are added to a builder object.
 * For further calculations to be correct, tuples MUST be added
 * in the order defined by the provided key definition. The builder
 * object stores hashes of all added tuples for each partial key,
 * e.g. for tuple (1, 2, 3) it stores hashes of (1), (1, 2), and
 * (1, 2, 3) in separate arrays. It doesn't store the same hash
 * multiple times in the same array (that's what the order is
 * required for), thus it knows how many unique encounters of each
 * partial key are there.
 *
 * Once all tuples have been hashed, the builder can be used to
 * create a bloom filter having the given false positive rate
 * for all lookups, both by full and by partial key. Since when
 * checking a tuple against a bloom filter, we check not only the
 * full key bloom, but also all partial key blooms, the actual
 * FPR of checking keys consisting of i parts will be equal to
 * the multiplication of FPRs of individual bloom filters storing
 * hashes of parts <= i. This allows us to use smaller FPR for
 * partial bloom filters and hence reduce the bloom filter size.
 * For more details, see tuple_bloom_new() implementation.
