 ************************** Posix Advisory Locking ****************************
 *
 * POSIX advisory locks are broken by design.  ANSI STD 1003.1 (1996)
 * section 6.5.2.2 lines 483 through 490 specify that when a process
 * sets or clears a lock, that operation overrides any prior locks set
 * by the same process.  It does not explicitly say so, but this implies
 * that it overrides locks set by the same process using a different
 * file descriptor.  Consider this test case:
 *
 *       int fd1 = open("./file1", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644);
 *       int fd2 = open("./file2", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644);
 *
 * Suppose ./file1 and ./file2 are really the same file (because
 * one is a hard or symbolic link to the other) then if you set
 * an exclusive lock on fd1, then try to get an exclusive lock
 * on fd2, it works.  I would have expected the second lock to
 * fail since there was already a lock on the file due to fd1.
 * But not so.  Since both locks came from the same process, the
 * second overrides the first, even though they were on different
 * file descriptors opened on different file names.
 *
 * This means that we cannot use POSIX locks to synchronize file access
 * among competing threads of the same process.  POSIX locks will work fine
 * to synchronize access for threads in separate processes, but not
 * threads within the same process.
 *
 * To work around the problem, sql has to manage file locks internally
 * on its own.  Whenever a new database is opened, we have to find the
 * specific inode of the database file (the inode is determined by the
 * st_dev and st_ino fields of the stat structure that fstat() fills in)
 * and check for locks already existing on that inode.  When locks are
 * created or removed, we have to look at our own internal record of the
 * locks to see if another thread has previously set a lock on that same
 * inode.
 *
 * The sql_file structure for POSIX is no longer just an integer file
 * descriptor.  It is now a structure that holds the integer file
 * descriptor and a pointer to a structure that describes the internal
 * locks on the corresponding inode.  There is one locking structure
 * per inode, so if the same inode is opened twice, both unixFile structures
 * point to the same locking structure.  The locking structure keeps
 * a reference count (so we will know when to delete it) and a "cnt"
 * field that tells us its internal lock status.  cnt==0 means the
 * file is unlocked.  cnt==-1 means the file has an exclusive lock.
 * cnt>0 means there are cnt shared locks on the file.
 *
 * Any attempt to lock or unlock a file first checks the locking
 * structure.  The fcntl() system call is only invoked to set a
 * POSIX lock if the internal lock structure transitions between
 * a locked and an unlocked state.
 *
 * But wait:  there are yet more problems with POSIX advisory locks.
 *
 * If you close a file descriptor that points to a file that has locks,
 * all locks on that file that are owned by the current process are
 * released.  To work around this problem, each unixInodeInfo object
 * maintains a count of the number of pending locks on tha inode.
 * When an attempt is made to close an unixFile, if there are
 * other unixFile open on the same inode that are holding locks, the call
 * to close() the file descriptor is deferred until all of the locks clear.
 * The unixInodeInfo structure keeps a list of file descriptors that need to
 * be closed and that list is walked (and cleared) when the last lock
 * clears.
 *
 * Yet another problem:  LinuxThreads do not play well with posix locks.
 *
 * Many older versions of linux use the LinuxThreads library which is
 * not posix compliant.  Under LinuxThreads, a lock created by thread
 * A cannot be modified or overridden by a different thread B.
 * Only thread A can modify the lock.  Locking behavior is correct
 * if the appliation uses the newer Native Posix Thread Library (NPTL)
 * on linux - with NPTL a lock created by thread A can override locks
 * in thread B.  But there is no way to know at compile-time which
 * threading library is being used.  So there is no way to know at
 * compile-time whether or not thread A can override locks on thread B.
 * One has to do a run-time check to discover the behavior of the
 * current process.
 *
 * sql used to support LinuxThreads.  But support for LinuxThreads
 * was dropped beginning with version 3.7.0.  sql will still work with
 * LinuxThreads provided that (1) there is no more than one connection
 * per database file in the same process and (2) database connections
 * do not move across threads.
