 * cell in the parent (calling) frame. When the memory cell is deleted or
 * overwritten, the VdbeFrame object is not freed immediately. Instead, it
 * is linked into the Vdbe.pDelFrame list. The contents of the Vdbe.pDelFrame
 * list is deleted when the VM is reset in VdbeHalt(). The reason for doing

 * calls to mem_destroy() when the memory cells belonging to the
