/**
 * Controls how to iterate over tuples in an index.
 * Different index types support different iterator types.
 * For example, one can start iteration from a particular value
 * (request key) and then retrieve all tuples where keys are
 * greater or equal (= GE) to this key.
 *
 * If iterator type is not supported by the selected index type,
 * iterator constructor must fail with ER_UNSUPPORTED. To be
 * selectable for primary key, an index must support at least
 * ITER_EQ and ITER_GE types.
 *
 * NULL value of request key corresponds to the first or last
 * key in the index, depending on iteration direction.
 * (first key for GE and GT types, and last key for LE and LT).
 * Therefore, to iterate over all tuples in an index, one can
 * use ITER_GE or ITER_LE iteration types with start key equal
 * to NULL.
 * For ITER_EQ, the key must not be NULL.
