/**
 * Point lookup is a special case of read iterator that is designed for
 * retrieving one value from an LSM tree by a full key (all parts are present).
 *
 * Iterator collects necessary history of the given key from different sources
 * (txw, cache, mems, runs) that consists of some number of sequential upserts
 * and possibly one terminal statement (replace or delete). The iterator
 * sequentially scans txw, cache, mems and runs until a terminal statement is
 * met. After reading the slices the iterator checks that the list of mems
 * hasn't been changed and restarts if it is the case.
 * After the history is collected the iterator calculates resultant statement
 * and, if the result is the latest version of the key, adds it to cache.

 * - It only scans in-memory level and cache and hence doesn't yield.
 * - It doesn't turn DELETE into NULL so it returns NULL if and only
 *   if no terminal statement matching the key is present in memory
 *   (there still may be statements stored on disk though).
 * - It doesn't account the lookup to LSM tree stats (as it never
