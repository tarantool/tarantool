/**
 * Hints are now used for two purposes - passing the index of the
 * key used in the case of multikey index and to speed up the
 * comparators.
 *
 * Scenario I. Pass the multikey index of the key to comparator.
 * In the case of multikey index arises an ambiguity: which key
 * should be used in the comparison. Hints act as an non-negative
 * numeric index of key to use.
 *
 * Scenario II. Speed up comparators.
 * Tuple comparison hint h(t) is such a function of tuple t that
 * the following conditions always hold for any pair of tuples
 * t1 and t2:
 *
 *   if h(t1) < h(t2) then t1 < t2;
 *   if h(t1) > h(t2) then t1 > t2;
 *   if h(t1) == h(t2) then t1 may or may not be equal to t2.
 *
 * These rules mean that instead of direct tuple vs tuple
 * (or tuple vs key) comparison one may compare their hints
 * first and only if theirs hints equal compare the tuples
 * themselves.
