	 * There are limitations when a subtree can be just copied
	 * as is from one parent to another.
	 * 1) It should not be a bar update. Because if it is not
	 *    a bar, then it is either scalar or an array/map.
	 *    Scalar update can be safely moved. Array/map update
	 *    doesn't change their parent, and also can be moved.
	 *    Otherwise see (2).
	 * 2) It is a bar. Then it should not be a leaf. If it is
	 *    not a leaf, then it does not change header and other
	 *    fields of this particular array, and can be safely
	 *    moved to somewhere else.
	 *    Otherwise see (3).
	 * 3) Ok, it is a bar, a leaf. Then it is a bar with zero
	 *    path length. It could degrade to zero path len in
	 *    during branching. In this case it should be a scalar
	 *    bar. The only non-scalar operations are '!' and '#'.
	 *
	 * Why '#' and '!' can't be moved? '!', for example, being
	 * applied to a field [1], affects all fields [2-*], and
	 * the array header. The same but in an even worse form
	 * about '#'. Such operations should be redone. They
	 * affect many fields and the parent.
	 *
	 * There is a tricky thing though - why not to just redo
	 * all operations here, for the sake of code simplicity?
	 * It would allow to remove 'create_with_child' crutch.
	 * The answer is - it is not possible. If a field is
	 * copyable, it is not re-applicable. And vice-versa. For
	 * example, if it is not a leaf, then there may be many
	 * operations, not one. A subtree just can't be
	 * 're-applied'.
	 *
	 * If the operation is scalar and a leaf, then its result
	 * has already overridden its arguments. This is because
	 * scalar operations save result into the arguments, to
	 * save memory. A second operation appliance would lead
	 * to very surprising results.
	 *
	 * Another reason - performance. This path should be
	 * quite hot, and to copy a struct is for sure much faster
	 * than to reapply an operation using a virtual function.
	 * Operations '!' and '#' are quite rare, so their
	 * optimization is not a critical goal.
