/**
 * @module replication - global state of multi-master
 * replicated database.
 *
 * Right now we only support asynchronous master-master
 * replication.
 *
 * Each replica set has a globally unique identifier. Each
 * replica in the replica set is identified as well.
 * A replica which is part of one replica set can not join
 * another replica set.
 *
 * Replica set and instance identifiers are stored in a system
 * space _cluster on all replicas. The instance identifier
 * is also stored in each snapshot header, this is how
 * the instance knows which instance id in the _cluster space
 * is its own id.
 *
 * Replica set and instance identifiers are globally unique
 * (UUID, universally unique identifiers). In addition
 * to these unique but long identifiers, a short integer id
 * is used for pervasive replica identification in a replication
 * stream, a snapshot, or internal data structures.
 * The mapping between 16-byte globally unique id and
 * 4 byte replica set local id is stored in _cluster space. When
 * a replica joins the replica set, it sends its globally unique
 * identifier to one of the masters, and gets its replica set
 * local identifier as part of the reply to the JOIN request
 * (in fact, it gets it as a REPLACE request in _cluster
 * system space along with the rest of the replication
 * stream).
 *
 * Replica set state on each replica is represented by a
 * table like below:
 *
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | replica id       | confirmed lsn |
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | 1                |  1258         | <-- changes of the first replica
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | 2                |  1292         | <-- changes of the local instance
 *   ----------------------------------
 *
 * This table is called in the code "vector clock".
 * and is implemented in @file vclock.h

	 * snapshot. They need one node which will boot first, and then they
	 * will replicate from it.
	 *

	 * It should have read_only = false, connection quorum satisfied, and be

	 * To be elected a Raft leader it needs to perform election. But it
	 * can't be done before at least synchronous quorum of the replicas is
	 * bootstrapped. And they can't be bootstrapped because wait for a
	 * leader to initialize _cluster. Cyclic dependency.
	 *
	 * This is resolved by truncation of the election quorum to the number
	 * of registered replicas, if their count is less than synchronous
	 * quorum. That helps to elect a first leader.
	 *

	 * and then strictly follow the protocol from now on, but that won't
	 * work, because if the first node will restart after it is booted, but
	 * before quorum of replicas is booted, the cluster will stuck again.
	 *

	 *
	 * - after all the cluster will have node count >= quorum, if user used
	 *   a correct config (God help him if he didn't);
