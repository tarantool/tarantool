tarantool (1.6.7.541.g89c4578-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New Debian snapshot for 1.6.7 stable release.
   - New tarantool doesn't have 8K tuples problem, closes: #704720.
   - New tarantool is built without Lua, closes: #655801.

  Major changes:

   - threaded architecture for checkpointing. Tarantool no longer
     forks to create a snapshot, but uses a separate thread,
     accessing data via a consistent read view. This eliminates all known
     latency spikes caused by snapshotting.
   - threaded architecture for network. Network I/O has finally
     been moved to a separate thread, increasing single instance
     performance by up to 50%.
   - stored procedures in C/C++. Stored procedures in C/C++
     provide speed (3-4 times, compared to a Lua version in
     our measurements), as well as unlimited extensibility
     power.
   - new HASH index implementation which respects slab_alloc_arena
     limit and uses significantly less memory.
   - RTREE index support (Memtx engine).
   - new 'upsert' command available in the binary protocol
     and in stored functions.
   - multi-master replication with support up to 30 peers.
   - logger option now accepts a syntax for syslog output. Use uri-style
     syntax for file, pipe or syslog log destination.
   - new version of sophia engine, with support of compression and multipart
     primary keys.
   - jit.*, jit.dump, jit.util, jit.vmdef modules of LuaJIT 2.0 are now
     available as built-ins.
   - better documentation and examples.
   - manifold performance improvements.
   - bug fixes.

  Incompatible changes:

   - fiber.channel.broadcast() was removed since it wasn't used by
     anyone and didn't work properly.
   - tarantoolctl "reload" command renamed to "eval".
   - panic_on_wal_error is on by default (gh-752)
   - functions which create objects (users, spaces, or functions)
     return an error if an object already exists. Use
     {if_not_exists=true} clause in create functions.
   - an update of the primary key was forbidden; use replace instead.

   Package changes:

   - Actualize debian/copyright
   - Remove support for GNU hurd architecture (doesn't work).
   - Don't use /var/lib/tarantool/started and /var/lib/tarantool/snapshot dirs.
   - Drop irrelevant README.Debian.
   - Remove old cron scripts.
