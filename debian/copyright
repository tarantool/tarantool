  The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the
  "Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best
  of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain
  of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby dedicates
  whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship
  identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover,
  dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and
  for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

  A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of
  this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield
  him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public
  domain.
  .
  Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and
  to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends
  this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all
  present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or
  contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of
  all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit
  or otherwise) those copyrights in the Work.
  .
  Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may
  be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon,
  or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or
  non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been
  invented or conceived.
