-- Idea of the test is that according to the Open Group standard,
-- open() always returns the smallest available descriptor. This
-- means, that in 'open() + close() + open()' the second open()
-- should return the same value as the first call, if no other
-- threads/fibers managed to interfere. Because of the
-- interference the sequence may need to be called multiple times
-- to catch a couple of equal descriptors.

-- Ensure, that GC does not break anything after explicit close.
-- Idea of the test is the same as in the previous test, but now
-- the second descriptor is used for something. If GC of the first
-- fio object is called even after close(), it would close the
-- same descriptor, already used by the second fio object. And it
-- won't be able to write anything. Or will write, but to a
-- totally different descriptor created by some other
-- fiber/thread. This is why read() is called on the same file
-- afterwards.
