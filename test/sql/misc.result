-- gh-4267: Full power of vdbe_field_ref
-- Tarantool's SQL internally stores data offset for all acceded
-- fields. It also keeps a bitmask of size 64 with all initialized
-- slots in actual state to find the nearest left field really
-- fast and parse tuple from that position. For fieldno >= 64
-- bitmask is not applicable, so it scans data offsets area in
-- a cycle.

-- work and the second lookup require parsing tuple from
