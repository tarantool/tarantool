-- gh-5613: when a new replica is joined to a cluster, it must prefer
-- bootstrapped join sources over non-bootstrapped ones, including self. Even
-- if all the bootstrapped ones are read-only. Otherwise the node might have
-- decided to bootstrap a new cluster on its own and won't be able to join the
-- existing one forever.
