-- gh-5433: leader, when elected, should resend rows to replicas starting from
-- the last acked vclock. Because they ignored all what was sent afterwards as
-- it didn't come from a leader.
--
-- There was a bug, that the local LSN wasn't passed to the restarted recovery
-- iterator, and it tried to find not existing files. This caused a reconnect
-- and a scary error message.
--

-- Increase local LSN so as without it being accounted during recovery cursor
-- restart it would fail, as it won't find the xlogs with first local LSN. Do
-- snapshots to mark the old files for drop.
