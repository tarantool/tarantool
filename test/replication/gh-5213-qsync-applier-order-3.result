-- test-run result file version 2
--
-- gh-5213: applier used to process CONFIRM/ROLLBACK before writing them to WAL.
-- As a result it could happen that the transactions became visible on CONFIRM,
-- then somehow weren't written to WAL, and on restart the data might not be
-- visible again. Which means rollback of confirmed data and is not acceptable
-- (on the contrary with commit after rollback).
--
-- To fix that there was a patch making synchro rows processing after WAL write.
-- As a result, the following situation could happen. Instance 1 owns the limbo,
-- instances 2 and 3 know about that. The limbo is not empty. Now instance 1
-- writes CONFIRM and sends it to the instances 2 and 3. Both start a WAL write
-- for the CONFIRM. Now instance 3 finishes it, creates a new synchro
-- transaction, owns the local limbo, and sends the transaction to the instance
-- 2. Here the CONFIRM WAL write is not done yet. It should not happen, that
-- the instance 3's new transaction is rejected. Because firstly instance 3 will
-- send the same instance 1's CONFIRM to the instance 2 due to it being earlier
-- in WAL of instance 3. Then on instance 2 it will block on a latch with
-- replica_id 1 until the original CONFIRM received from the instance 1 is
-- finished. Afterwards the instance 3's transaction is applied just fine - the
-- limbo on instance 2 is empty now.
--
-- It is not related to read-views, but could break the replication.
