-- The following block of tests - e_select-1.4.* - test that the description

--
-- EVIDENCE-OF: R-49872-03192 If the join-operator is "CROSS JOIN",
-- "INNER JOIN", "JOIN" or a comma (",") and there is no ON or USING
-- clause, then the result of the join is simply the cartesian product of
-- the left and right-hand datasets.
--
--    The tests are built on this assertion. NUMBERly, they test that the output

--    of calculating the cartesian product of the left and right-hand datasets.
--
-- EVIDENCE-OF: R-46256-57243 There is no difference between the "INNER
-- JOIN", "JOIN" and "," join operators.

--
--    All tests are run 4 times, with the only difference in each run being
--    which of the 4 equivalent cartesian product join operators are used.
